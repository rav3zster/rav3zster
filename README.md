Rav2zster's Digital Garden 🪴
Welcome to my space. Here, I'm cultivating my skills, one line of code at a time.

About Me
I'm a student on a journey to master the world of AI and software development. My goal is to transform theoretical knowledge into practical, innovative solutions. I believe that every commit, no matter how small, is a step towards becoming a better developer.

Current Focus
🌱 I'm currently immersing myself in TensorFlow and advanced Data Structures & Algorithms to build a strong foundation.

💡 I'm applying my skills to new ideas in Prompt Engineering, exploring how to communicate with AI more effectively.

🤝 I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects. Feel free to reach out!

This badge shows my top languages. As I create more projects, this will become a more accurate reflection of my skills. It's a journey, not a destination!

The Road Ahead
This garden is still young, but I'm excited to watch it grow. My next step is to add my first major project to my profile. I plan to create a repository for my Fish Classification project, complete with a detailed README and clean code.

Once that project is live, it will be proudly pinned here.
